      <a name=paragraph><p>I started backcountry skiing in 2013. I am very familiar with a few <strong>14ers</strong>, <strong>Berthoud Pass</strong>, and have branched out into <strong>Jones Pass</strong>, the <strong>I-70 Corridor</strong>, as well as other routes along the <strong>Front</strong>, <strong>10-Mile</strong>, <strong>Gore</strong>, and <strong>Sawatch</strong> ranges. </p></a>
